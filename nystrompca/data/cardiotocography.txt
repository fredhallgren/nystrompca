Data Set Information:

2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.


Attribute Information:

LB - FHR baseline (beats per minute) 
AC - # of accelerations per second 
FM - # of fetal movements per second 
UC - # of uterine contractions per second 
DL - # of light decelerations per second 
DS - # of severe decelerations per second 
DP - # of prolongued decelerations per second 
ASTV - percentage of time with abnormal short term variability 
MSTV - mean value of short term variability 
ALTV - percentage of time with abnormal long term variability 
MLTV - mean value of long term variability 
Width - width of FHR histogram 
Min - minimum of FHR histogram 
Max - Maximum of FHR histogram 
Nmax - # of histogram peaks 
Nzeros - # of histogram zeros 
Mode - histogram mode 
Mean - histogram mean 
Median - histogram median 
Variance - histogram variance 
Tendency - histogram tendency 
CLASS - FHR pattern class code (1 to 10) 
NSP - fetal state class code (N=normal; S=suspect; P=pathologic)
