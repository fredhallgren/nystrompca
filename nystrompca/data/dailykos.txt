Data Set Information

D is the number of documents, W is the
number of words in the vocabulary, and N is the total number of words
in the collection (below, NNZ is the number of nonzero counts in the
bag-of-words). After tokenization and removal of stopwords, the
vocabulary of unique words was truncated by only keeping words that
occurred more than ten times. Individual document names (i.e. a
identifier for each docID) are not provided for copyright reasons.

This data sets have no class labels, and for copyright reasons no
filenames or other document-level metadata. These data sets are ideal
for clustering and topic modeling experiments.
